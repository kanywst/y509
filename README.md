- üî¥ **Expired**: Certificate has already expired

## Examples

### Viewing a Website's Certificate Chain

```bash
# Get certificate chain from a website
echo | openssl s_client -connect github.com:443 -showcerts 2>/dev/null | y509
```

### Analyzing Local Certificate Files

```bash
# View a single certificate
y509 server.crt

# View a certificate chain
y509 fullchain.pem

# View multiple certificates
cat *.crt | y509
```

### Advanced Usage with Command Mode

#### Certificate Chain Validation
1. Launch y509 with your certificate file
2. Press `:` to enter command mode
3. Type `validate` to check the entire chain
4. Review validation results, errors, and warnings

#### Search and Filter Operations
```bash
# Search for specific certificates
:search example.com       # Find certificates for example.com
:search "Let's Encrypt"   # Find Let's Encrypt certificates
:search 192.168.1.1       # Find certificates with specific IP

# Filter by certificate status
:filter expired           # Show only expired certificates
:filter expiring          # Show certificates expiring soon
:filter valid             # Show only valid certificates
:filter self-signed       # Show self-signed certificates

# Reset filters
:reset                    # Show all certificates again
```

#### Export Certificates
```bash
# Export in different formats
:export pem server.pem    # Export as PEM format
:export der server.der    # Export as DER format
```
